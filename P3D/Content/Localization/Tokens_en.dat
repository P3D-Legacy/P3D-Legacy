VoltorbFlip_BeforeGame_NoCoinCase,You don't have a Coin Case!~Come back when you have one!

VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Message,Voltorb Flip is a game in which~you flip over cards to find~numbers hidden beneath them.*The cards are hiding the~numbers 1 through 3...~and Voltorb as well.*The first number you flip over~will give you that many Coins.*From then on, the next number~you find will multiply the~total amount of Coins you've~collected by that number.*If it's a 2, your total will~be multiplied by "x2".*If it's a 3, your total will~be multiplied by "x3".*But if you flip over a~Voltorb, it's game over.*When that happens, you'll lose~all the Coins you've collected~in the current level.*If you select "Quit", you'll~withdraw from the level.*If you get to a difficult~spot, you might want to end~the game early.*Once you've found all the~hidden 2 and 3 cards,~you've cleared the game.*Once you've flipped over~all these cards, then you'll~advance to the next level.*As you move up in levels,~you will be able to receive~more Coins. Do your best!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Message,The numbers at the side~of the board give you a clue~about the numbers hidden on~the backs of the cards.*The larger the number, the~more likely it is that there~are many large numbers hidden~in that row or column.*In the same way, you can tell~how many Voltorb are hidden~in the row or column.*Consider the hidden number~totals and the Voltorb~totals carefully as you~flip over cards.
